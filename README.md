## A problem of our community about Responsible Consumption and Production

In 2016, only 20% of the world’s e-waste was recycled.

The total amount of electronic waste generated globally in 2019 was 53.6 million tons, an increase of 21% in 5 years; it is expected to reach 74 million tons in 2030

Nearly 63 million tons of electronic waste will be generated globally in 2021

Hong Kong generates about 70,000 tonnes of waste electrical and electronic products every year, about 85% of which are "four electrical appliances and one computer"

The global recycling and reuse rate of electronic waste is only 17.4%.

### The reason leading to the problem 

Insufficient infrastructure to handle waste or safely recycle old materials and lack proper recycling

Nowadays, the durability of electrical appliances is declining, making maintenance difficult and expensive.

The wave of smartphone replacements has increased the amount of electronic waste.

Hong Kong has the highest per capita amount of e-waste in Asia.
